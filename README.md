# Johnson-Counter-
A Johnson counter (also called a twisted ring counter) is a special type of shift register counter that cycles through 2 × n unique states using n flip-flops.      It works by shifting bits from one flip-flop to the next on each clock pulse.      The inverted output of the last flip-flop is fed back into the first flip-flop’s input.
